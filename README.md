# Cromi
Cromi was a public transit app for Santiago de Chile's public transit system, formerly known as Transantiago, designed and developed by me from late 2016 until 2020. It originally used a (later-disabled) API from Transantiago itself, and later, a full-featured API from [Ignacio Hermosilla](https://nacho.dev).

### What was it like?
[Here's the design case study](https://radu.cl/work/cromi/), scroll down for some demo videos.

### It won't compile!
Cromi depends on my internal library, RaduKit, and therefore, it won't compile as-is, sorry. Even if it did, because the APIs are gone, it wouldn't do much.
